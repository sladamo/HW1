      <li><b>If an Advertisement Runs Online and No One Sees It, Is It Still an Ad? Empirical Generalizations in Digital Advertising,</b> <em>ARF Journal of Advertising Research Vol. 53, No. 2, pp.192-199</em>, June 2013</li><br/>

      This study presents findings from three charter studies involving leading global advertisers in three key geographical regions: United States, Europe and Canada.
      The goal of the research was to identify and better understand the incidence of sub-optimal digital campaign delivery as it pertains to viewability, audience delivery, geographic targeting and brand safety.
      Through an evaluation of the study findings, several significant empirical generalizations emerged, and this article highlights these generalizations and discusses their implications for the digital advertising ecosystem.

      <li><b>The Post-Recession American Shopper,</b> <em>WARC Admap Magazine Vol. 45, No. 8, Issue 519, pp. 16-18</em>, September 2010</li><br/>

      Online retail spending among U.S. consumers has continued to grow, not just despite the global recession but because of it.
      Shoppers have seized the chance to research goods online to get the best value for money.
      Recent research shows consumers will abandon brand loyalty in favour of value when money is tight.
      Internet retail giants Walmart and Amazon have both grown online revenue in recent years.
      While both spent heavily on marketing, they did so strategically, notably engaging with consumers through social media channels.
      The recession has arguably ushered in a new era of digital marketing that will remain far into the future.
